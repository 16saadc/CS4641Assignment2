Hiya! The exact .arff files I used to run my simulations will be located at this link https://github.com/rohanrk/Machine-Learning-4641

supervised-learning -> data 

All experiments were run in Weka 3.8.3

Decision Tree

Classifiers -> Trees -> J48

- Varied Confidence Factor and minNumObj

Boosting

Classifiers -> Functions -> AdaBoostM1 

KNN

Classifiers -> Lazy -> IBK

- Varied K

Neural Net

Classifiers -> Functions -> MultiLayerPerceptron

- Varied learning rate and training time

SVMs

Classifiers -> Functions -> SMO

- Varied type of kernel between polynomial and RBF.
- Varied exponent for polynomial and gamma for RBF
